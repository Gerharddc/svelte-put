  <p>
    It is strange asking for money; but here I am. I'm based in Vietnam where Github Sponsor has not
    added support just yet. In the meantime, to donate, please visit <ResourceLink
      href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vnphanquang">buymeacoffee/vnphanquang</ResourceLink
    >. Thank you very much for your support.

  <h2>A Hello</h2>
  <p>
    Why would you donate? I honestly don't know. I build this collection mainly for myself; it is
    open source and my code is largely inspired by other open source projects. And you too can use
    it however you wish. So if you find it useful, just reach out to say hello and let me know what
    amazing project you are building. That probably means more to me than a donation
    <span class="text-2xs opacity-75"
      >(unless your donation can help me pay the rent, of course)</span

    Stop by <ResourceLink href="https://github.com/vnphanquang/svelte-put/discussions/223"
      >this Github discussion thread</ResourceLink
    > and say hello!
