## Inspiration & Acknowledgement

There is already a great pool of [svelte actions collected by Shawn
and other contributors](https://github.com/sw-yx/svelte-actions) that you should check out. There
might be some duplications here and there. However:

- Shawn's project aims to be a source for RFCs into Svelte; I believe stuff I am putting here should stay in user land.
- I prefer having separate packages for their dedicated purposes (instead of one package that exports everything).
- I want to incrementally include more than just actions int his collection.

For those reasons, a monorepo seems
like a good fit, hence this project. To contribute or support the project, head over to the
[contributing page](/docs/contributing). Happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíª
